# atm-simulation
This is an atm simulation command-line application in terms of an interview assignment 
We need an application that simulates the Backend logic of a cash dispensing
Automatic Teller Machine (ATM).
Of course the application is not required to distribute money, but it should be
able to simulate and report the out come of people requesting money.
This simulation will not require any authentication or PIN to access the ATM.
Rather it is to be focused on keeping track of the current cash of the ATM,
and dispensing only the notes available.

It should be possible to tell it that it has so many of each type of note during
initialisation. After initialisation, it is only possible to remove notes.
It must know how many of each type of bank note it has and it should be able
to report back how much of each note it has.
It must support $20 and $50 notes.
It should be able to dispense only legal combinations of notes. For example, a
request for $100 can be satisfied by either five $20 notes or two $50 notes. It
is not required to present a list of options.
If a request cannot be satisfied due to failure to find a suitable combination of
notes, it should report an error condition in some fashion. For example, in an
ATM with only $20 and $50 notes, it is not possible to dispense $30.
Dispensing money should reduce the amount of available cash in the
machine.
Failure to dispense money due to an error should not reduce the amount of
available cash in the machine.
